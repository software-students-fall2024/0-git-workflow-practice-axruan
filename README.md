## My thoughts
This article details the upcoming features of Apple Intelligence and provides and overview of what to expect. Included in the iOS 18 update, Apple Intelligence introduces a range of AI-driven tools across a range of products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

I think the article is interesting because it demonstrates the real-world applications of AI. It showcases the ability for AI to become something we can use rather than rely on. As someone who uses a lot of Apple devices, I also find it interesting just from the standpoint of a consumer. I also thought it was noteworthy that instead of directly calling it artificial intelligence, Apple went with "Apple Intelligence."
