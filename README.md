[Apple Generative AI](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-iphone-16-ai-features/)

I think the article is interesting because it demonstrates the real-world applications of AI. It showcases the ability for AI to become something we can use rather than rely on. As someone who uses a lot of Apple devices, I also find it interesting just from the standpoint of a consumer. I also thought it was noteworthy that instead of directly calling it artificial intelligence, Apple went with "Apple Intelligence."
